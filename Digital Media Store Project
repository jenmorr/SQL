--In the following project, I'm working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

/*Here is a breakdown of the tables included in the chinook database:
employees table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.
 customers table stores customers data. The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related (ie, how you would JOIN them).
 The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc) and the invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).
 artists table stores artists data.
 albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.
 media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.
 genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
 tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.
 playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. 
The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship.*/


--Here are the questions I queried the database to find answers to and the SQL code I used to execute those queries:

/*Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").*/
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

/*Show only the Customers from Brazil.*/
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

/*Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.*/
SELECT DISTINCT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
WHERE invoices.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'
ORDER BY customers.CustomerId;

/*Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.*/
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

/*Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.*/
SELECT DISTINCT invoices.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

/*Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.*/
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)

/*What are the total sales for 2009?*/
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.*/
SELECT inv.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
JOIN chinook.tracks 
ON tracks.TrackId = inv.TrackId;

/*Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.*/
SELECT ar.name as Artist, t.Name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a
ON a.AlbumID=t.AlbumID
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar

/*Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.*/
SELECT tracks.Name AS track_name,  albums.Title AS album_title, media_types.Name AS media_type, genres.Name AS genre_name

JOIN chinook.albums
ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types
ON tracks.MediaTypeId = media_types.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres
ON genres.GenreId = tracks.GenreId;

/*Show the total sales made by each sales agent.*/
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

/*Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?*/
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
